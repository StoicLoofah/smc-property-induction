"I was looking for animals from the same genus at the least before moving the needle on agree/disagree.   I would not accept any argument that because a chimp/whale has something that a horse would.  Evolution is a tricky thing."
"I tried to consider the class of animals described and how well they either represented a broader classification (i.e. mammals) or if they were a smaller subset (jungle cats, sea mammals, etc.)"
"I was remembering the animals that had the enzyme and seeing if the question was about them. "
"trying to decide the similarity and number of different animals."
"I concentrated on the relation between the animals having the enzymes, and then compared them to the animals that were asked about."
"I judged how related each of the animals were to each other for the likelyhood that it meant that a particular animal would have the same enzyme as another animal. "
"Deciding if mammals have the same DNA"
"I thought I did well considering the fact that for most of the questions not enough information was given. "
"Comparing similar types of animals."
"I was relating each animal listed with the others in it\'s group and evaluating the animals\' similarities and whether they are likely to have the same enzymes.  If the animals were all different, the likelihood of all mammals having the same enzyme as these animals seemed higher."
"Just because three different animals have the same particular gene, does not mean all mammals do, or that another mammal will have it.  I only replied that another mammal has that gene when it was implicitly stated that \"all mammals have ** gene\" in your sentences.  "
"Reading the statements and answering questions."
"A little puzzled. the only one that made sense was that all mammals have a certain enzyme, therefore the mammal mentioned had it."
"i was thinking about evolutionary trees."
"I would pay attention to the type of animals listed, what they had in common to then choose how I felt about the following statement."
"I basically looked at what animals were compared, and based my answer on the information given, as well as how similar the animals named were."
"I was reading the names of the animals and guessing that if the animals were similar then they must have that enzyme."
"looking for categorical statements about large groups like all mammals"
"I looked at the types of animals listed to decide if it was a wide enough variety of animals to represent all mammals or possibly include the one in question at the end of the example."
"I was looking for how homogenous the examples were, and then rating them based on this."
"I was reading the sentences presented and then make a determinations of how solid the argument was based off the information"
"based on the similarity or differences of the animals i believed it was a mammal trait, or a herbivore trait or carnivore"
"I performed this task by not assuming any generalities. That\'s why I strongly disagreed with generalizations that were presented to me, e.g., \"All mammals...\" because I did not have enough information about each specific enzyme."
"This may be useful in a research study."
"I\'m a biologist, so I know that conclusions can\'t be drawn just because something seems like it could be related.  Unless all mammals have a certain enzyme, then I can\'t conclude that other organisms are related."
"Comparing the examples given to the subject given in the final question on each for similiarities."
"by how related the animals were"
"If the animals that had the enzyme were similar, I was less convinced that all mammals or a dissimilar animal also had the enzyme. However, if the animals didn\'t seem similar, I figured the questionable animal probably had a 50/50 chance - so I would pick 5."
"I was clicking on a radial button to indicate my selection and then pressing the space bar to continue."
"Tried taking notes but it got a little complicated so instead i took note of the animals listed with each enzyme and tried to answer the question correctly."
"I was given information about enzymes that certain mammals have and answered if the particular enzyme exist in all mammals or particular animals by selecting a degree of my agreement or disagreement."
"I tried to find a similarity or diversity between the animals mentioned. If I felt the animals mentioned came from a diverse group, then more likely the statement was true."
"nothing special"
"I was trying to determine how related the given animals were and then compare them to the item (animal or group such as mammals) questioned about. "
"With logic just because some animals have this enzyme doesn\'t mean that ALL mammals do. i choose the yes for the one that had all mammals have it and the question was if a certain mammal had it."
"Logically reasoning between the different types of animals and judging how similar they were. "
"I figured groups of similar creatures would probably have common genes/enzymes. Groupings of more widespread animals would represent mammals as a whole probably & of course if it says all mammals well then ya."
"If a wide variety of mammals have this, I figure all mammals do. If only similar animals have this, then I don\'t necessarily think all mammals do."
"I was reading the animals to see if they are in similar families. I generally thought that you can not make a conclusion about all animals based on a few subjects."
"I felt that generalizations regarding all mammals are dangerous to make, so I only applied things to them if the examples were diverse.  Also, I felt that applying things to one animal wasn\'t a good practice unless the example was directly related, like two dogs."
"I was remember the animals for each section and how it would relate to the end question. "
"I was using the space bar to click to each page. If there were three animals with the same I usually gave a 7 if 2 a 6 and if it said all mammals a 9"
"I looked at the animals that were being listed if they were all mammals."
"In general if the predicate contained \"all mammals\" I\'d answered high if the conclusion statement was about a mammal, if it contained a member of the same species as the conclusion (e.g. dalmatian and collie), I answered high, otherwise I answered low."
"I\'ve read and figured out the probability for the best answers. "
"I compared the similarity of the animals to determine if they might have the same enzyme."
"I was deciding how closely related the mammals listed were, and whether their relationship was likely to include (most) mammals or just a particular family - if two rodents shared an enzyme, it might not be shared by all mammals, but if something was shared by a rodent, an elephant, and a primate, it was more likely to be shared with all mammals. "
"In order to determine if all mammals or X animal had the enzyme, I evaluated the facts given and consulted my knowledge of biology to see if it was plausible."
"I guessed how closely related the animals in the propositions were to guess how likely it was the animals in the conclusion shared the same trait. For example, if the animals in the propositions were distantly related I thought it would be more likely for all mammals to share that trait."
